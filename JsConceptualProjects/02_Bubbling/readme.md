This project is made on the core basis of the Event Bubbling concept


Event bubbling is like a small wave starting at a point and moving outward. When you click a button inside a box, the "click" event starts at the button and then moves up to the box, then to the container holding the box, and so on. Each time it reaches a new level, it can trigger any special actions set for that level. So, clicking the button can also trigger actions set for the box and the container.
